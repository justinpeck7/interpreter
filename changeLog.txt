    --------------   -----------------------------------------------------------
    SubDeclaration   new class that implements the declaration of a subroutine
    SubCall			 new class that calls a given subroutine 
    CodeSegment		 new class that holds subroutine data
            
                     
    MODIFIED         DESCRIPTION
    --------------   -----------------------------------------------------------
    Statement        added two cases to getStatement to recognize SubDeclaration and SubCall
    Token            added "sub" and "call" to the list of keywords
    MemorySpace      fixed searching for variables only on the local scope, added calls to new CodeSegment
    If               rewrote so no statements/expressions were evaluated in constructor
    Repeat           changed MemorySpace calls so that new scopes were created for each loop

    VarDeclaration   new class that implements the declaration of one or more 
                     local variables in the current scope 


    MODIFIED         DESCRIPTION
    --------------   -----------------------------------------------------------
    Statement        added a case to getStatement to recognize a VarDeclaration
    Token            added "var" to the list of keywords
    MemorySpace      added logic to handle scopes
    If               added calls to create a new scope before statement execution and destroy it after
    Repeat           added calls to create a new scope before statement execution and destroy it after
    While            added calls to create a new scope before statement execution and destroy it after
                     added check to make sure condition expression evaluates to a boolean
